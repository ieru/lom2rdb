IERU REST Engine
================

About
-----
This is a simple REST Engine written in PHP, with a focus on being fast and lightweight. It requires an API written also in PHP and placed in the same folder of this engine (it must be called Ieru), according to the PSR-0 standard (there is an example in the Github project [IERU Organic.Edunet APIs](https://github.com/ieru/ieru-oe-apis)). Further documentation for building an API example will be added in the future. It does not require any external libraries.


Usage
-----
Please, refer to the ieru-api-server project for installation instructions.
